        //b) Auto Implemented property
        //    used when there is no need for additonal code/logic,

        // NO internal private data member is required for this property
        // the system will internally generate a data area for the data

        //Constructors
        //a constructors is "a method" that guarantees that the newly
        //   created instance of this class will ALWAYS be created in
        //   a known state

        //constructors are optional
        //IF a class DOES NOT have a constructor then the system
        //   will generate the class instance using the datatype defaults
        //   for your private data members and auto implemented properties
        //this situation of no constructor(s) uses what is referred to as
        //   a "System" constructor

        //IF you code a constructor, you MUST code any and all constructors
        //   needed by your class

        //constructors CAN receive a list of parameters
        //two common constructors for classes are the Default and Greedy constructor

        //Default constructor
        //this version of the constructor takes NO parameters
        //this version of the constructor usually similates the System constructor
        //you CAN if you wish assign values to your class data members/properties
        //    that are NOT the system default for that datatype
        // NO RETURN DATATYPE!!!!
        //This "method" is call on your behave when an instance of the class
        //   is requested by the outside user
        //You CAN NOT call this "method" directly
        public Window()

            //Height = 36.0m;  //preferred method of touching any data in the class 
        }

        //Greedy Constructor
        //takes in a value for each data member/property in the class
        //each data member/property is assigned the incoming parameter value
